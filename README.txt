If you accidently press T or C that will
pop up one of the menus that are incomplete
and still need bug testing. If you collide
with the green planet you will get an option
to enter the planet. If you select yes
then you will enter an incomplete planet
level and will not be able to go back to
outerspace. Please restart the game if you
do so. To cheat press Ctrl + G. You will
unlock all gates, become ghost, and
equip a new laser that does 10x damage.
